# Sharktale
A casual adventure fast-paced arcade-style game.

# About
A simple underwater-themed game built in C using the Raylib library. In this game, YOU control a shark navigating through an ever-flowing ocean environment. Using ASWD, players assist the shark in consuming fishes to gain points. The sharks also need to avoid dangerous obstacles such as ship anchors and explosive barrels to avoid imminent death or point deduction. The ultimate goal is to survive all 3 levels and finish the game.
